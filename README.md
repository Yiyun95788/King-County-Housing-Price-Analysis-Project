# King County Housing Price Analysis Project
This project is part of our STA302 Methods and Data Analysis I final project at the University of Toronto. This project explores the impact of various housing characteristics on King County house prices using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). It includes data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization to uncover real estate pricing trends.

## Overview  
- Investigated the relationship between housing characteristics (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, waterfront) and prices.  
- Applied MLR techniques to analyze data with over 21,613 observations.  
- Developed insights for real estate pricing trends in King County, Washington.

## Dataset  
- **Source**: [King County Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/burhanykiyakoglu/predicting-house-prices/data).  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - `price`: Sale price of the house.  
  - `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.  
  - `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.  
  - `sqft_living`: Living area in square feet.  
  - `waterfront`: Binary indicator for waterfront properties.

## Methodology  
- Cleaned dataset by removing outliers and handling multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).  
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations such as histograms and scatterplots.  
- Built and compared initial and log-transformed regression models.  
- Evaluated models using metrics like Adjusted RÂ² and AIC.
